## Important changes from previous courses
This iteration of the Machine Learning Foundations course includes several changes that we believe will provide students with a more valuable learning experience and a more valuable set of tools going forward. The two biggest changes are:

- Moving from Graphlab Create to Turi Create: Graphlab is being replaced by Turi Create. Changing to this new library ensures continued technical support for the library. Additionally, unlike Graphlab which required students to obtain a temporary license, Turi Create is open-source, meaning that you will be able to continue using Turi Create even after finishing the course.
- Moving from Python 2 to Python 3: On January 1st of 2020, Python 2 will be retired. Therefore, we are shifting the course to use the more modern Python 3.
